intros:
    javascript-flavors: >
        As JavaScript matures, developers are starting to look
        beyond its borders and create various languages and dialects that
        compile to JavaScript. 
    front-end-frameworks: >
        The front-end remains the key battleground for JavaScript. But now
        that the dust has cleared, it's starting to look like only two
        combattants are left standing…
    data-layer: >
        The data layer regroups all the technologies used to transmit and manage data. 
        It's a vast category where many approaches compete to make a tricky problem more
        approachable.
    back-end-frameworks: >
        JavaScript on the back-end hasn't seen any major breakthroughs in recent years. 
        But compared to the rest of the ecosystem's frenetic pace,
        many will say that this is a blessing, not a curse. 
    testing: >
        Testing, testing… Is this thing on? Sorry, I Jest, but I would never want to make a Mocha-ry 
        of this section. That would be Jasmine (“just mean”? get it?), and that's bad Karma.
    mobile-and-desktop: >
        “Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.”
        JavaScript is not limited to the browser anymore, and it's only
        a matter of time until your smart toaster burns your bread because NPM is down. 
    other-tools: >
        Other tools that didn't quite fit in any other category.
    opinions: >
        To find out how developers view the current JavaScript ecosystem, 
        we asked them how much they agreed or disagreed with the following opinions.
    demographics: >
        We wanted to learn more about our survey respondents.
